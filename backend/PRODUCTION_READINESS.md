Production readiness checklist and approach for the ReactAdmin-Refine backend

This document describes the recommended, actionable approach to make the `backend/` FastAPI service production-ready. It covers architecture, API versioning, security, CI/CD, observability, testing, and operational concerns. Use this as a prioritized checklist and reference during the migration and hardening work.

1. Goals and success criteria

- Robust runtime behavior in production: no uncaught exceptions, retries for transient failures, and healthy liveness/readiness probes.
- Observable: structured logs, metrics, distributed traces, and error reporting.
- Secure: secrets are not in repo, TLS enforced, cookies and tokens configured securely, dependencies scanned.
- Repeatable deployments: Docker images built deterministically and deployed via CI/CD to staging and production.
- Backwards-compatible API releases with clear versioning strategy and deprecation policy.
- Scalable: horizontally scalable app instances, pooling for DB/redis, cache invalidation working across instances.

2. High-level architecture recommendations

- Package layout: adopt an `app/` package layout (api, core, db, services, auth, cache, schemas). Keep `main.py` small and use `app.api.v1` routers.
- API versioning: use URL-based versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`). Include OpenAPI docs at `/api/v1/openapi.json` and interactive docs at `/docs` or versioned docs.
- Database: use SQLAlchemy with Alembic for migrations. Keep sessions short and use connection pooling tuned to your environment.
- Caching: Redis for permission cache and pub/sub invalidation. Use tenant-prefixed keys as already implemented.
- Auth: JWT access tokens and server-side refresh tokens (opaque, rotating). Keep refresh token cookie as HttpOnly, SameSite=strict/lax per client needs, Secure=true in production.

3. API versioning and compatibility

- Start with path-versioning: all routes under `/api/v1/...`. Add `app/api/v1` package and register router under `include_router(prefix='/api/v1')`.
- Deprecation policy: when introducing breaking changes, release a new version (`/api/v2`) and maintain v1 for a deprecation window (documented in release notes).
- Semantic versioning for the application: tag Docker images with `major.minor.patch` and a `latest` or branch-based tag.
- OpenAPI and client generation: keep OpenAPI stable per API minor release; publish OpenAPI artifacts per release (e.g., to S3) so clients can pin generated SDKs.

4. Configuration and secrets

- Centralize config with `pydantic.BaseSettings` (e.g., `app/core/config.py`) and prefer environment variables. Keep a `.env.example` but never commit real secrets.
- Secrets management: use a secret manager in production (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, GCP Secret Manager). CI should inject secrets into the runtime environment.
- Sensitive defaults: make `TENANT_COOKIE_SECURE=true` default in production; allow override through env vars for dev/test.

5. Security hardening

- TLS: terminate TLS at the load balancer or with an ingress controller; enforce HSTS.
- Cookies: set `secure=True`, `httponly=True` (for refresh token), `samesite=strict` or `lax` based on cross-site requirements. Use short TTLs for access tokens.
- CORS: restrict allowed origins to known front-end hosts.
- Headers: add security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options) via middleware.
- Rate limiting: use an API gateway or middleware (Redis-backed) to rate limit per IP/tenant.
- Dependency scanning: add SCA (GitHub Dependabot, Snyk) to detect vulnerable packages.
- Secrets scanning: add a pre-commit hook and scanning in CI to avoid accidental commits.

6. Migrations and DB lifecycle

- Add Alembic and store migrations in `backend/migrations/`.
- CI should run migration tests against ephemeral DBs (or a test DB) and staging deploys should run `alembic upgrade head` as part of deployment.
- Backups: automatic DB backups and recovery plan. Test restores regularly.

7. Observability

- Logging: JSON structured logs (include request id, user id, tenant id). Provide log correlation id middleware (X-Request-Id).
- Metrics: instrument HTTP requests, latency, DB pool usage, cache hit/miss, and custom metrics (permissions cache invalidations) with Prometheus client.
- Tracing: add OpenTelemetry tracing (instrument FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, outgoing HTTP). Export traces to a collector (Tempo/Jaeger) in staging to validate.
- Error reporting: integrate Sentry or similar for production exception telemetry.

8. Health checks and readiness

- Expose `/health` for basic liveness (app alive) and `/ready` that checks DB/redis connectivity.
- Kubernetes readiness/liveness probes should hit these endpoints.

9. CI/CD and deployment

- CI steps: run tests, run type checks (mypy/pyright), run linters (ruff/black/isort), build Docker image, scan dependencies, and optionally run contract tests.
- CD strategy: stage -> canary -> production, or blue/green. Use image tags tied to git SHA and store artifacts in a registry.
- Rollback: keep last known good images and a rollback process (automated or one-click).

10. Containerization and runtime

- Build a small Docker image (multi-stage). Use a pinned Python base image (e.g., `python:3.11-slim`) and install only required packages.
- Run with an ASGI server (uvicorn + gunicorn's uvicorn workers or just uvicorn with multiple workers behind a process manager). Tune `workers` based on CPU.
- Add entrypoint that validates required env vars and optionally runs migrations.

11. Testing strategy

- Unit tests: run fast and in CI.
- Integration tests: run against ephemeral DB and redis instances (docker-compose or in CI containers).
- Contract/API tests: verify OpenAPI contract if you have client code depending on API shape.
- Load tests: schedule periodic load tests against staging; capture latency and error rates.

12. Performance and scaling

- Use connection pooling and tune pool sizes relative to expected concurrency and DB resources.
- Cache expensive RBAC/permissions lookups (you already have Redis caching); document cache invalidation semantics thoroughly.
- Add horizontal autoscaling (Kubernetes HPA) and design the system for stateless scaling.

13. Backup and disaster recovery

- DB automated backups and tested restores.
- Redis persistence or backups depending on usage; if Redis is ephemeral caching, ensure no single point of failure for critical session data.

14. Observability runbook and runbook playbooks

- Create runbooks for common incidents: DB outage, caching outage, high error rate, unauthorized access.
- Document on-call escalation and dashboards/alerts thresholds (e.g., 5xx rate > 1% for 10 minutes).

15. API lifecycle and versioning details

- Version via path `/api/v1/...`.
- Create a `deprecation` header (or response body) that indicates sunset dates for old APIs.
- Maintain a changelog and release notes per API version.

16. Practical next steps (ordered)

1) Create `app/` package skeleton and move `main.py` wiring into `app.main`; keep `backend/main.py` as backward-compatible entry during migration.
2) Add Alembic and generate an initial migration from current models.
3) Add `app/core/config.py` and migrate env lookups to `pydantic.BaseSettings`.
4) Add a lightweight Dockerfile (multi-stage) and a CI workflow that runs `scripts/run_checks.sh` and builds an image.
5) Add health/readiness endpoints and readiness checks for DB/Redis.
6) Add structured logging and request id middleware.
7) Add Prometheus metrics instrumentation and OpenTelemetry tracing support.
8) Harden cookie and token defaults for production (Secure=true, short access token TTLs, rotation ensured).
9) Add GitHub Actions / Pipeline to run tests + typechecks + build images and optionally deploy to staging.
10) Run load tests against staging and tune DB pool/cache settings.

17. Helpful commands and references

- Install Alembic and generate migration:

  python -m pip install alembic
  alembic init backend/migrations

- Build Docker image locally (from repo root):

  docker build -f backend/Dockerfile -t myorg/backend:dev .

- Run checks locally:

  ./scripts/run_checks.sh

18. Ownership and timelines

- Break migration into small PRs focusing on moving one module at a time (cache, then auth, then crud, then api routers).
- Aim to have skeleton + Docker + CI in 1–2 days. Full production hardening (observability, tracing, SCA, DR) may take 2–4 weeks depending on the team's capacity.

If you want, I can start implementing the first few steps:
- scaffold an `app/` package skeleton (safe),
- create a Dockerfile (safe), and
- add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs the checks (safe).

Tell me which you'd like me to implement next and I'll do it incrementally.
