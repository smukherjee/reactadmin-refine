# API Implementation Summary

## Completed: Health and Metrics Endpoints ✅

I have successfully implemented comprehensive health and metrics endpoints as specified in the ARCHITECTURE.md checklist. The implementation is now complete and fully tested.

### Implemented Endpoints

#### Core Health Endpoints
- **`GET /health`** - Basic health check for load balancers
  - Returns: status, timestamp, version, environment
  - Always returns 200 OK for simple uptime checks

- **`GET /health/detailed`** - Comprehensive health check
  - Checks: Database, Redis, System resources
  - Returns: detailed component status with metrics
  - Status: "healthy" or "degraded" based on component health

#### Kubernetes-Compatible Endpoints  
- **`GET /readiness`** - Kubernetes readiness probe
  - Tests critical dependencies (DB, Redis)
  - Returns: "ready" or "not_ready" with error details

- **`GET /liveness`** - Kubernetes liveness probe
  - Simple alive check (always returns "alive")
  - Used to determine if pod should be restarted

#### Monitoring Endpoints
- **`GET /metrics`** - System performance metrics
  - CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, uptime
  - Compatible with monitoring systems like Prometheus

#### API Documentation
- **`GET /api/v1/info`** - API version and endpoint documentation
  - Lists all available endpoints by category
  - Useful for API discovery and documentation

### Implementation Details

#### Dependencies Added
- **`psutil>=5.9.0`** - System monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
- Added to both `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`

#### Integration Points
- **Database Health**: Uses SQLAlchemy to test database connectivity with `SELECT 1`
- **Redis Health**: Tests Redis connectivity with `ping()` and retrieves memory/client stats
- **System Health**: Uses `psutil` for real-time system resource monitoring

#### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation: Individual component failures don't crash the endpoint
- Detailed error reporting in health checks
- Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

### Test Coverage ✅

Created comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_health.py`) with 7 test cases covering:

1. **Basic health endpoint** - Status and response structure
2. **Detailed health endpoint** - All components and their metrics
3. **Metrics endpoint** - System performance data validation
4. **Readiness endpoint** - Kubernetes probe compatibility
5. **Liveness endpoint** - Simple alive check
6. **Cache status endpoint** - Redis connection status
7. **API info endpoint** - Documentation endpoint

**All 24 tests pass** (17 existing + 7 new health tests)

### Existing API Structure

The application already had a robust API structure with 21 endpoints covering:

#### Authentication & Sessions
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication with JWT tokens
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh with rotation
- `POST /auth/logout` - Session termination
- `GET /auth/sessions` - List user sessions
- `POST /auth/logout-all` - Terminate all user sessions

#### User Management
- `POST /users` - User registration
- `GET /users` - List users (tenant-scoped)
- `POST /users/{user_id}/roles` - Role assignment

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- `POST /roles` - Create roles
- `GET /roles` - List roles (tenant-scoped)  
- `POST /roles/{role_id}/assign-test` - Role assignment testing

#### Multi-tenancy
- `POST /tenants` - Create tenant organizations

#### Caching & Performance
- `GET /cache/status` - Redis cache status
- `POST /cache/clear` - Clear cache (admin only)

#### Audit & Compliance
- `POST /audit-logs` - Create audit log entries

#### Security Testing
- `GET /protected/resource` - Permission-protected endpoint for testing

### Architecture Compliance

This implementation addresses the **"Health and metrics endpoints"** requirement from ARCHITECTURE.md:

✅ **Enterprise-ready monitoring** - Kubernetes-compatible health checks  
✅ **System observability** - Real-time performance metrics  
✅ **Component health tracking** - Database, Redis, and system monitoring  
✅ **Load balancer integration** - Simple health endpoint for uptime checks  
✅ **Error diagnostics** - Detailed error reporting for troubleshooting  
✅ **Test coverage** - Comprehensive test suite ensuring reliability  

The health endpoints are now production-ready and follow enterprise monitoring best practices. They integrate seamlessly with the existing authentication, RBAC, and multi-tenant architecture.

### Next Steps

The health and metrics implementation is complete. The remaining ARCHITECTURE.md checklist items are:

- [ ] Config via pydantic BaseSettings  
- [ ] Database migrations (Alembic)
- [ ] CI pipeline running tests+typechecks
- [ ] Dockerfile and container run instructions
- [ ] Structured logs and request/response logging  
- [ ] Rate limiting and security headers via middleware
- [ ] Secrets management guidance

The API structure is enterprise-ready with comprehensive health monitoring capabilities.
